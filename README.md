# Windows-Auto-brightness
Created an auto-brightness system for Windows computers using Python.

Technologies used:
  • opencv-python: OpenCV is the backbone of the project, enabling me to capture webcam frames and perform sophisticated image processing, crucial for accurate light analysis. 
  • screen-brightness-control: This library enables the project to dynamically adjust the screen brightness based on the calculated ambient light conditions, ensuring a seamless viewing experience in different lighting environments.
  • pygetwindows: PyGetWindow played a significant role in interacting with windows and screen properties. It provided the necessary functionality to access window properties, a crucial step in ensuring the seamless adjustment of screen brightness.
  • pyinstaller: PyInstaller was instrumental in converting my Python script into a standalone executable. This allows the application to run independently without requiring users to install Python or any additional dependencies.
